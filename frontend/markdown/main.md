## Exposure

The amount of light that hits a recording medium.

- Three controls in a camera
- Measured in stops

--

### Shutter Speed

A shutter controls how long the film/digital sensor is exposed to light.

- Flap on pinhole camera
- Curtains on an SLR

--

### Aperture

A shutter controls how long the film/digital sensor is exposed to light.

- Adjustable in the lens
- Size of the hole which light travels through.
- Measure in F-stops

--

### Sensitivity (ISO/Film Speed)

Different mediums have varying sensitivity to light.

- Flap on pinhole camera
- Curtains on an SLR

--

### Light is Measured in Stops

One stop is a complete halving/doubling in the amount of light.

---

## In Practice

--

### Pressing the Shutter Button

- Half Press = Light Meter
- Full Press = Take Image

--

### Metering

Using the camera to read the amount of light.

- Evaluative
- Spot

--

### Focusing

- Aperture dertermines DoF.
- Person decides where to focus the camera

--

### Manual Mode

Set all exposure settings manually.

--

### Priority Modes

Set one point in exposure triangle.

- Shutter Speed
- Aperture

--

### Exposure Compensation

Increase or decrease the exposure from light meter.

---

## Creative Decisions

- Exposure Triangle for Creative Effect
- Subject/Background
- Composition

--

### Wide Aperture (low f-stop)

- Shallow depth of field

## Workflow

How to manage and edit images.

## File Formats

RAW vs. JPG

- Quality vs. Filesize
- Many raw file formats, including  K25, KDC (Kodak), CR2 (Canon), ERF (Epson), MEF (Mamiya), MOS (Leaf), NEF (Nikon), ORF (Olympus), PEF (Pentax), RW2 (Panasonic) and ARW, SRF, SR2 (Sony), are based on the TIFF file format.[4] These files may deviate from the TIFF standard in a number of ways, including the use of a non-standard file header, the inclusion of additional image tags and the encryption of some of the tagged data.

--

### DNG

Adobe's solution to RAW files. Widely seen as the standard RAW format. Conversion from camera specific to DNG possible through Lightroom, Bridge, etc.

--

### Software

- Adobe Lightroom
- ImageCapture
- Bridge
- Finder/Explorer

## What Camera Should I Use?
