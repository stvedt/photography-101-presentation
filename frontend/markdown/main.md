## What is a Camera?

A lightproof box that refracts light to project an image onto a medium for recording.

- Camera Obscura
- Pinhole Camera
- Single-Lens Reflex (SLR)

### Camera Obscura

### Pinhole Camera

--

### Single-Lens Reflex (SLR)

--

### Lens

Modifies the light before entering the camera body.

- Focal Length
- Aperture

--

### Sensor/Film

- Captures and records the actual images
- Less dynamic range than our eyes

--

### Shutter

- Flap on pinhole camera
- Curtains on an SLR

---

## Exposure

The amount of light that hits a recording medium.

- Three controls in a camera
- Measured in stops

--

### Light is Measured in Stops

A stop is a halving/doubling of light.

--

### Shutter Speed

A shutter controls how long the film/digital sensor is exposed to light.

- Flap on pinhole camera
- Curtains on an SLR
- Full stops: 1/500s, 1/250s, etc.

--

### Aperture

A shutter controls how long the film/digital sensor is exposed to light.

- Adjustable in the lens
- Size of the hole which light travels through.
- Measure in F-stops
- Full stops: f/2.8, f/5, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f22

### Sensor/Film Sensitivity


Different mediums have varying sensitivity to light (Measured with ISO & Film Speed).

- Higher sensitivy = more light
- Risk of noise/grain

---

## In Practice

--

### Through the Viewfinder

- Exposure Settings
- Light Meter
- Focus Points
- Aperture is always wide open. (DoF Preview Button)

--

### Pressing the Shutter Button

- Half Press = Light Meter & Focus
- Full Press = Take Image

--

### Metering

Using the camera to read the amount of light.

- Evaluative
- Spot

--

### Focusing

- Aperture dertermines DoF.
- Person decides where to focus the camera

--

### Manual Mode

Set all exposure settings manually.

--

### Priority Modes

Set one point in exposure triangle.

- Shutter Speed
- Aperture

--

### Exposure Compensation

Increase or decrease the exposure from light meter.

---

## Creative Considerations

- Exposure Triangle for Creative Effect
- Subject/Background
- Composition

--

### Wide Aperture (low f-stop)

- Shallow depth of field

--

### Narrow Aperture (high f-stop)

- Wide depth of field

--

### Fast Shutter Speed

## Workflow

How to manage and edit images.

--

## File Formats

RAW vs. JPG

- Quality vs. Filesize
- Many raw file formats, including  K25, KDC, CR2, ERF, MEF, MOS, NEF, ORF, PEF, RW2 and the list goes on.

--

### DNG

Adobe's solution to RAW files. Widely seen as the standard RAW format. Conversion from camera specific to DNG possible through Lightroom, Bridge, etc.

--

### Software

- Adobe Lightroom
- ImageCapture
- Bridge
- Finder/Explorer

---

## What Camera Should I Use?

"The best camera is the camera you have with you."

DSLR = Highest Quality, Maximum Control & Flexibility

Point & Shoot = Control & Convenience

Phone = Convenience

--

### iPhone/SmartPhones

The key the ability to take control.

Control/lock focus and exposure.

--

### Noteworthy Apps

- Camera+
- SnapSeed
- VSCOcam
- Afterlight
- SlowShutter
- iOS8 (Manual Controls)
- Lenstag
- EyeFi
